<strong><em>“On the Piazza side, and outside the usable volume, all public movement facilities have been centrifuged. On the opposite side, all the technical equipment and pipelines have been centrifuged. Each floor is thus completely free and it can be used for all forms of cultural activities- both known and yet to be discovered.”</em></strong>
